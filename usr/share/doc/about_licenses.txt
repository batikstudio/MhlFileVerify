MHL File Verify
License: GPL
Author: Victor Zamora - Batik Studio

Description: Mhl File Verify for Linux is a tool written in Python and Qt to verify and seal data according to the implementation of the MHL standard.
You can choose a standard mhl file created from Clone Tool of Davinci Resolve and other tools to check if the copy was correct.
Also you can generate a new mhl file from a data folder just like Clone Tool does.

This software is based on and includes the original mhl-tool by Pomfort (see terms of license bellow) compiled by us to different plattforms.
